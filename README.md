Diagrams:
In the class diagram, there are a few discrepencies with the software we used. We talked 
to professor Gosh and he said to explain them in the read me, and no points would be 
deducted.
 
	1. The first issue is that on methods, when passing a parameter of List<something>, the 
	software will not let us put in the less than/greater than symbols <>. So instead of 
	"methodName(List <Players>) : Void" / we have "methodName(List Player) : Void".
	
	2. The arrows for association do not have an arrowhead on the end of them -->. They 
	are just a regular line. We understand this is incorrect. I have included the direction 
	arrow for the association by the description so you know which way the arrow head is 
	suppose to point. 
	
	3. The enumeration classes are not connected with association lines. Professor Gosh 
	said this is fine.
